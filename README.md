# A_simple_helpdesk_support_ticket_management_application
 Use Next.js for front-end, Express.js for back-end, and MySQL database for WeTicket app and My Tickets System.

# For full-stack developers test at NIPA TECHNOLOGY COMPANY LIMITED
 The application requirements are fully met as stated in the prompt, which will work in the MyTickets-back-end folder. However, since this application can be further developed in the future, a website for purchasing that is not yet complete has been created in the WeTicket-front-end folder as well. Therefore, I am notifying you to be aware of this.
