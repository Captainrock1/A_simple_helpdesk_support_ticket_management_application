WeTicket is a simple helpdesk support ticket management application that consists of:

• A RESTful-compliant API backend using Express.js with a MySQL database.

• A SPA-styled frontend application using Next.js for the website template.

The application must be capable of:

• Creating a new ticket with the following information: title, description, contact information, created timestamp, and latest ticket update timestamp with the 'Create Ticket' button in the 'My Ticket' menu.

• Updating a ticket's information and status (pending, accepted, resolved, rejected) by choosing the ticket in the 'My Ticket' menu that you want to update.

• Listing and sorting tickets by status, latest update, and filtering tickets using status in the 'Ticket Categories' menu.

• Ensuring that once a ticket is created, it cannot be deleted by any means.

• Having a UI workflow, such as a Kanban board, for updating a ticket's status.

• Using SQL and MySQL database for the datastore and deploying it via Cyclic.

This application is modified and created by Peerapon Chaijittiprasert (Captain)
